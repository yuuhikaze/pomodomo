# PomoDomo

PomoDomo is a pomodoro timer with minimal modifications to its core mechanism.

### Changes

-   **Opt-in Long Break**
    By default, all breaks are short breaks. Users can opt for a long break available after the completion of four cycles, via an upgrade button that becomes available after each cycle set.
    > Skip the upgrade when you don't feel like taking a long break, and use it when you do.

-   **Task Scoping** [TODO]
    Set an estimated number of cycles for a task. If completed earlier, the time remaining for cycle completion is added; if completed later, the time elapsed since target is subtracted.
    > It is not meant for the user to pursue a maxima in this metric, as it could generate stress; but rather, to use it as an indicator to get better at scheduling.
